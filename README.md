# DIY Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard

## 1. Description

The DIY Bluetooth Mechanical Keyboard is a custom-designed wireless keyboard with an ergonomic 6 degree tilt, a slide potentiometer for analog input, USB Type-C connectivity, and hot-swappable MX-style switches. It includes a detachable wrist rest for comfort and features embedded passive NFC tags that can be used for mobile automations or other creative integrations.  

This keyboard was made to be easily built and remixed by others. The entire design uses mostly through-hole components. Only the diodes are surface-mount, which makes it much easier to assemble without needing any special tools.

## 2. Why I Made This Project

I designed this keyboard for myself with daily use in mind. I wanted something compact, reliable, and comfortable to use, especially during long sessions. Most wireless keyboards don't come with embedded passive NFC tags and some still even use micro USB for charging and wired mode. This one uses USB Type-C and Bluetooth, and can also be recharged easily.

The project also gave me a chance to learn about PCB layout, 3D CAD, component sourcing, and firmware setup. I wanted to build something I could be proud of and share with others who might want to build their own.
